#Definition of the unit cell
acell 3*10.216         # This is equivalent to   10.18 10.18 10.18
# rprim gives FCC (https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/210963/primitive-unit-cell-of-fcc)

#Definition of the atom types
ntypat 1          # There is only one type of atom
znucl 14          # The keyword "znucl" refers to the atomic number of the 
                  # possible type(s) of atom (here Si). The pseudopotential(s) 
                  # mentioned in the "files" file must correspond
                  # to the type(s) of atom. Here, the only type is Silicon.
                         

#Definition of the atoms
# remark that bulk Si has a diamond structure, containing double the amount of
# atoms in the primitive cell as would be for a FFC lattice with 1 atom as motif
natom 2           # There are two atoms
typat 1 1         # They both are of type 1, that is, Silicon.
xred              # This keyword indicate that the location of the atoms
                  # will follow, one triplet of number for each atom
   0.0  0.0  0.0  # Triplet giving the REDUCED coordinate of atom 1.
   1/4  1/4  1/4  # Triplet giving the REDUCED coordinate of atom 2.
                  # Note the use of fractions (remember the limited 
                  # interpreter capabilities of ABINIT)

#Definition of the planewave basis set

#Definition of the SCF procedure

                  # is described in the "dielng" input variable section.
                  # Here, we follow the prescription for bulk silicon.
