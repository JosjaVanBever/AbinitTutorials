1) from MP
- Problems with units (angstrom vs hartree) or parameters (wrong order of ecut).

2) from MP
- Good converged.

3) perturbed
- Representative convergence curves => selection of 16_*4
- No optimal convergence => divergence in 2ndP

4) perturbed, with restriction to symmetry
- Good convergence, no 2ndP divergence 

5) perturbed, with strikter convergence
- Good convergence, no 2ndP divergence
