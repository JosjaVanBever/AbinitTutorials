 getcut : COMMENT -
  Note that boxcut > 2.2 ; recall that boxcut=Gcut(box)/Gcut(sphere) = 2
  is sufficient for exact treatment of convolution.
  Such a large boxcut is a waste : you could raise ecut
  e.g. ecut=   20.838215 Hartrees makes boxcut=2

 getcut : COMMENT -
  Note that boxcut > 2.2 ; recall that boxcut=Gcut(box)/Gcut(sphere) = 2
  is sufficient for exact treatment of convolution.
  Such a large boxcut is a waste : you could raise ecut
  e.g. ecut=   20.838215 Hartrees makes boxcut=2

 getcut : COMMENT -
  Note that boxcut > 2.2 ; recall that boxcut=Gcut(box)/Gcut(sphere) = 2
  is sufficient for exact treatment of convolution.
  Such a large boxcut is a waste : you could raise ecut
  e.g. ecut=   20.838215 Hartrees makes boxcut=2

 setup1 : take into account q-point for computing boxcut.
 
 getcut: wavevector=  0.2500  0.0000  0.0000  ngfft=  30  30  30
         ecut(hartree)=     16.000   => boxcut(ratio)=   2.24336
 
 getcut : COMMENT -
  Note that boxcut > 2.2 ; recall that boxcut=Gcut(box)/Gcut(sphere) = 2
  is sufficient for exact treatment of convolution.
  Such a large boxcut is a waste : you could raise ecut
  e.g. ecut=   20.130710 Hartrees makes boxcut=2

 The perturbation idir=   3  ipert=   1 is
 symmetric of a previously calculated perturbation.
 So, its SCF calculation is not needed.
 
 
 The perturbation idir=   1  ipert=   2 is

 setup1 : take into account q-point for computing boxcut.
 
 getcut: wavevector=  0.5000  0.0000  0.0000  ngfft=  30  30  30
         ecut(hartree)=     16.000   => boxcut(ratio)=   2.20457
 
 getcut : COMMENT -
  Note that boxcut > 2.2 ; recall that boxcut=Gcut(box)/Gcut(sphere) = 2
  is sufficient for exact treatment of convolution.
  Such a large boxcut is a waste : you could raise ecut
  e.g. ecut=   19.440530 Hartrees makes boxcut=2

 The perturbation idir=   3  ipert=   1 is
 symmetric of a previously calculated perturbation.
 So, its SCF calculation is not needed.

 setup1 : take into account q-point for computing boxcut.
 
 getcut: wavevector=  0.2500  0.2500  0.0000  ngfft=  30  30  30
         ecut(hartree)=     16.000   => boxcut(ratio)=   2.24481
 
 getcut : COMMENT -
  Note that boxcut > 2.2 ; recall that boxcut=Gcut(box)/Gcut(sphere) = 2
  is sufficient for exact treatment of convolution.
  Such a large boxcut is a waste : you could raise ecut
  e.g. ecut=   20.156700 Hartrees makes boxcut=2

         ecut(hartree)=     16.000   => boxcut(ratio)=   2.20572
 
 getcut : COMMENT -
  Note that boxcut > 2.2 ; recall that boxcut=Gcut(box)/Gcut(sphere) = 2
  is sufficient for exact treatment of convolution.
  Such a large boxcut is a waste : you could raise ecut
  e.g. ecut=   19.460745 Hartrees makes boxcut=2

 getcut : COMMENT -
  Note that boxcut > 2.2 ; recall that boxcut=Gcut(box)/Gcut(sphere) = 2
  is sufficient for exact treatment of convolution.
  Such a large boxcut is a waste : you could raise ecut
  e.g. ecut=   20.122046 Hartrees makes boxcut=2

 getcut : COMMENT -
  Note that boxcut > 2.2 ; recall that boxcut=Gcut(box)/Gcut(sphere) = 2
  is sufficient for exact treatment of convolution.
  Such a large boxcut is a waste : you could raise ecut
  e.g. ecut=   19.452081 Hartrees makes boxcut=2

 getcut : COMMENT -
  Note that boxcut > 2.2 ; recall that boxcut=Gcut(box)/Gcut(sphere) = 2
  is sufficient for exact treatment of convolution.
  Such a large boxcut is a waste : you could raise ecut
  e.g. ecut=   19.463633 Hartrees makes boxcut=2

 Suggested references for the acknowledgment of ABINIT usage.

 The users of ABINIT have little formal obligations with respect to the ABINIT group
 (those specified in the GNU General Public License, http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.txt).
 However, it is common practice in the scientific literature,
 to acknowledge the efforts of people that have made the research possible.
 In this spirit, please find below suggested citations of work written by ABINIT developers,
 corresponding to implementations inside of ABINIT that you have used in the present run.
 Note also that it will be of great value to readers of publications presenting these results,
 to read papers enabling them to understand the theoretical formalism and details
 of the ABINIT implementation.
